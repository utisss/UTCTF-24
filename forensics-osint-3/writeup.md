So, we're looking for an IP.
Let's look around for clues.
In the comment section of the youtube video, Cole mentions he might make a wiki for a game called Tiny Island Survival.
If we go back to reddit, we'll notice he's a moderator of the subreddit r/TinyIslandSurvival.
If we visit it on old reddit, we'll see a link on the sidebar to the wiki.
We can check the edit history and see that oops! his IP address was logged there when he made an edit.

Common Questions:

Is the linktree the centralized location? Yes, you can reach any site (not page) you need for the challenge in 3 clicks.

Do I need to use wayback/find an old reddit account? The "new" hint is not referring to time.
