If we continue our search for Cole Minerton, the next site we'll likely come across is his reddit account.
We can see he has a mastodon, so let's check that out.
There's a few images on there, I wonder where they were taken?
Searching for "sav o mat New Mexico" from the first image reveals that there's not a lot of these gas stations.
If we go off the messages from discord, we know that he lives about 7 hours from Telluride so we can rule out a couple of these locations.
Or you could just try them all (there's not a lot), and if we check the Raton location on Google maps we'll find it's located at the corner of Cimarron Ave and 2nd Street (which we can get from the picture)

Why isn't Angel Fire working? It's not Angel Fire

Hint? Ask them what they've found, if they don't say Mastodon they need to keep looking
