  A reimagined version of our iconic Insanity Check: Redux challenge from UTCTF 2023.

  The flag is in CTFd this time, but, as always, you'll have to work for it.

  (This challenge does not require any brute-force -- as per the rules of the competition,
  brute-force tools like dirbuster are not allowed, and will not help you here.)
