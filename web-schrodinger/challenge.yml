  Hey, my digital cat managed to get into my server and I can't get him out.

  The only thing running on the server is a website a colleague of mine made.

  Can you find a way to use the website to check if my cat's okay? He'll likely be in the user's home directory.

  You'll know he's fine if you find a "flag.txt" file.
